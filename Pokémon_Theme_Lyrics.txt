I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause

I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Teach Pokemon to understand
The power that's inside

Pokemon! Gotta catch 'em all
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon! Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend

Pokemon! Gotta catch 'em all
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me, and I'll teach you
Pokemon!
Gotta catch 'em all, gotta catch 'em all
Yeah

Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place

Come with me, the time is right
There's no better team
Arm in arm, we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream

Pokemon! Gotta catch 'em all
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon! Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend

Pokemon! Gotta catch 'em all
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me, and I'll teach you
Pokemon!

Gotta catch 'em all, gotta catch 'em allGotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Yeah

Pokémon! Gotta catch 'em all
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokémon! Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend

Pokémon! Gotta catch 'em all
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me, and I'll teach you
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all, gotta catch 'em all
Pokémon
